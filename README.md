# Total Entity Replacer

## English description for steam users 
Tired of the usual entities from Half-life 2? So I present you this mod, which allows you to replace entities from HL2 with any you want. A big medkit instead of a standart medkit? Easy.
How about a few variations? Sure.
I moving on to the functions that this mod can do:
- You can replace any entity from HL2 such as Battery Armor, Grenades, Ammo Weapons and even the MedKit Station.
- The ability to disable replacement for some entities, such as Grenades.
- And most importantly to choose several variations of replacements for one weapon, for which I made the addon.
- Ability to randomize weapons. Just don't fill the table and the weapons will be randomized

Inspired by this [addon](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2919720308&searchtext=entity+replacer) mod to replace the entity, but it was inconvenient, especially you have to restart the map to apply the settings and limited to add weapons. So I created this miracle

And if you find bugs, please, please, report about bug. I will try to fix them. Also do not mind suggestions for improvement (for example, add something).
