# Total Replacer
Tired of the standard NPCs? Or maybe even Entities? I've created and released my own addon for a total replacement for NPCs, Entites, SWEPs and even Transports!

What the hell is that?
The Total Replacer (or just TR) replaces standard in-game stuff with whatever you want. Thanks to my creations, you can replace with your chosen Entities right in the game without restarting the map. Among other addons to replace anything I could not find a good option, so I created this miracle. Although, the first replacement addon was TWR (Total Weapon Replacer) , which replaced the standard weapons with what you choose. But the new TR addon can now replace more than just weapons. And there are additional replacement options, I'll write about them.

Features of this addon
Replace most standard entities.
Additional parameters for replacing (The rarity or chance of replacement, as well as the specific weapon for NPCs when replaced.). Just right-click on choosed icon and configure what you want.
Replacing Entities with other types of items.
Presets for saving and fast loading (Really handy).
Randomization and the ability to turn it off In utilities.
Select and disable substitutions for the items you need.
Pretty good optimization (just don't heaven forbid you look into my code)

FAQ:
Q:I'm not getting weapons, entities, transportation, and weapons replaced in NPCs. The console reports errors, and at the top of the errors - Attempted to create unknown entity type 'entity name'!
A: Reconfigure your NPC replacements, weapons, etc. Most likely you have set to replace entities that you have disabled in the game menu.
Q: I don't want to write in the console, I want a menu with settings, where is it located?
A: The menu is in Utilities and it is called Total Replacer.
I will be updating the FAQ in the future.
